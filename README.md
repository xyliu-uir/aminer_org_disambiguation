# aminer_org_disambiguation
The code written during the internship in [ZhipuAI](https://www.zhipuai.cn/) and is mainly used to handle the issue of organization disambiguation.
Thanks to the learning and work experience during this period, which allowed me to be exposed to the state-of-the-are research on large scale language models(ChatGLM) and excellent Open Academic Graph products(Aminer).
